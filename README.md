# NSE Stock Scanner 📈

A **Python-based NSE stock scanner** that calculates **technical indicators for ~2000 NSE-listed stocks** and automatically **pushes the results to Google Sheets** for easy analysis, filtering, and discovery.

This project is designed for traders, investors, and analysts who want **centralized, always-updated technical data** without juggling multiple tools.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 📊 Scans **~2000 NSE stocks** in one run
* 🧮 Computes **popular technical indicators** using Python
* ☁️ **Auto-syncs results to Google Sheets**
* 🔍 Easy filtering, sorting, and discovery inside Sheets
* ⚡ Fully automated & scriptable
* 🧩 Modular design (add/remove indicators easily)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Fetches **historical price & volume data** for NSE stocks
2. Processes data using **Python technical analysis libraries**
3. Calculates indicators for each stock
4. Structures results into a clean tabular format
5. Pushes data to **Google Sheets via API**
6. Sheet becomes a **live technical scanner dashboard**

## 📊 Google Sheets Integration

Google Sheets acts as the **front-end UI**:

* Filter stocks by indicator values
* Sort by RSI, MACD crossover, trend strength, etc.
* Create watchlists
* Add conditional formatting
* Share with teammates

This makes the scanner **non-technical-user friendly** while keeping Python as the backend engine.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* Pandas / NumPy
* Technical Analysis libraries (e.g. TA-Lib / pandas-ta)
* Google Sheets API
* Google Service Account authentication
